# Overall Description

## Component Overview

Gantray Display is divided into 2 parts:

BE: This mainly contains all the business logic and also decides what
needs to be send to frontend. It also stores data into ViewModels and
various states.

FE: It is basically WPF application with MI.GantryDisplay.NgUi which is
nothing but Angular application contained in it. WPF mainly controls
Physio part of frontend and remaining FE part if handled by Angular.

Gantry Display is responsible for:

-   Showing Pscope Image from SNAC and also controls windowing and
    persistance of same.

-   Showing user latest SNAC positions.

-   Handling Collimator and Detector change.

-   Handling various operations like Homing, TouchPad Test, Retract,
    Reset, Unload.

-   IqSpect Planning and Planar Offset.

-   Displaying various Scan Parameters, scan progress status and also
    syncs Executions Controls buttons.

-   Syncs Calibration Scans.

Apart from above, Gantry Display BE also contains a process called
RemoteLauncher to launch GantryDisplay remotely in console machine.

Gantry Display also conatins a project called Cryptography which handles
Encryption/Decryption related things for security.

Abbildung 1: ComponentOverview

## Design Principles

GantryDisplayApp is a part of MIOne platform. Overall design principle
shall be based on Domain Driven Design concepts to align with the H
Framework.

GantryDisplay contains BE and FE

FE is the angular UI which is hosted in IIS.

BE communicate to SNAC through SystemInterface layer to get scanner
data.

BE also communicates to Exam Layer through H communication to get
exam/scan related data.

BE also communicates to calibration process through H communication to
display calibration scan related data.

## Assumptions, Dependencies, and Limitations

### Assumptions

GantryDisplayApp is part of SPECT application.

### Dependencies

GanrtyDisplayApp shall be depending on Exam, SystemInterface, H
Framework components, Physio etc.

### Limitations 

# Component Interface

## API Overview

## Error Handling and Logging Policy

Error handling logging is based on Native syngo EMH concepts.

For logging Gantry Display has its own project named
\"MI.NM.GantryDisplayLogger.Impl\" which handles Logging for gantry
display.

Errors from Angular App and WPF App will be forwarded to Gantry Display
backend for logging using above assembly.

### Logging Domain

### Trace Domain and Markers

The component uses FTrace as the tracing mechanism. Logging is done
using the syngo mechanism to write to the event log. Shall be realized
through tracing AOP provided by H framework.

### Tools

## API Definition

## Deployment View

### Configuration Files

### Licensing

### Backup Restore

### Installation

This will be deployed as a library and will be the part of Denali
package installer.

This class diagram describes the whole gantry display application, which
includes both front end and back end. This diagram shows various
components and communication between them. This includes SignalR
communication between angular clients and back end hubs, H communication
between gantry display back end and Exam/Calibration/System layer.

Following class diagram also shows, how gantry display angular
application is hosted in IIS and how gantry display FE(WPF application)
is browsing to the IIS hosted angular app.

### GantryDisplayPlanning

The class diagram to show the relationship between classes and
interfaces involved in IQSpect and Planar planning operation.

![](./image9.emf)

Abbildung 8: GantryDisplayPlanning

### GantryOperations

The class diagram to describe relationship between classes for change
collimator operation in gantry display. User can install required
collimators depending on scan to be performed. For example, LEHR
collimator while performing planar scans and Smart zoom collimator for
IQSpect planning. Collimator has its own set of detector configurations,
that need to configured before the scan.

![](./image10.emf)

Abbildung 9: CollimatorChangeOperation

The class diagram to show various gantry operations that user can
perform in gantry display. Those operations include collimator change,
touch pad test, unload, retract, homing, configure gantry etc. Mainly
gantry display back end has IOperationsMonitor and IOperation interfaces
to handle various gantry operations.

![](./image11.emf)

Abbildung 10: GantryOperations

### IQSPECT

The class diagram to show the relationship between classes and
interfaces involved in IQSpect operations. Prerequisites to enable
IQSpect planning are cardiac IqSpect protocol to be loaded, smart zoom
collimator need to be installed and detectors should be in IqSpect
configuration. On moving IqSpect planning box to focus on interested
area, user can start IQSpect planning. User can do IqSpect move and
cancel operations to move detectors to focused area and to cancel or
re-center the IQSpect planning respectively.

![](./image12.emf)

Abbildung 11: IQSpect Operations

### Planar Offset

The class diagram to show relationship between classes and interfaces
for planar offset. For any planar scan protocol, when user changes zoom

### PowerSave

The class diagram to show power save mode in gantry display. When user
has not done any interaction or when system is inactive for 10 minutes,
then system interface invokes power save mode. The same is notified to
gantry display. As soon as gantry display is notified with power save,
system enters into power save mode. User can wake up the system, either
by touching gantry display device or by doing any interaction in ICS.

### IQSPECT

The sequence diagram to show the sequential flow of enabling IqSpect
execution controls in the gantry display UI. When IQSpect planning is
enabled and planning box appears in the UI, user does IQSpect planning
by moving the box. Initially IQSpect execution controls like Move and
Cancel are disabled. Once user starts moving planning box, Move button
is enabled in the gantry display UI.

![](./image37.emf)

Abbildung 36: Enable IQSpect Execution Controls

The diagram describes the operational flow of canceling IQSpect move
operation, in sequence. IQSpect move operation is cancelable operation.
Once user performs move operation, meanwhile user can cancel ongoing
detectors move operation. On click of cancel, from gantry display UI,
gantry display back end sends cancel command to SNAC to cancel ongoing
operation. SNAC either sends gantry setup completed event with canceled
status, indicating success or it sends event with error, indicating
failure.

![](./image38.emf)

Abbildung 37: IQSpect Cancel Operation

The sequence diagram to show the flow of performing IQSpect move
operation. Once user is fine with focused area during IQSpect planning,
user clicks IQSpect Move button. IQSpect box position points are sent to
SNAC. Detectors are moved focusing planned area. If auto move of
detectors is success, SNAC sends success status and updates IQSpect
positions. Otherwise it sends gantry setup completed with error.
